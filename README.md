## âœ¨ Project Description

This project is a modern, responsive **Sign-Up and Login user interface** built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It features a clean, professional design enhanced with **glassmorphism**, smooth animations, and a fully functional **dark mode toggle** that remembers user preferences across pages using `localStorage`.

Both pages `signup.html` and `login.html`â€”are designed to be visually consistent, mobile-friendly, and developer-friendly. They are linked for seamless navigation and maintain the userâ€™s theme preference even when switching between pages.

The layout emphasizes user experience with accessible labels, balanced spacing, and clear call-to-action buttons. Whether you're prototyping a new product, learning UI/UX concepts, or looking for a sleek template to build on, this project is a great starting point.
